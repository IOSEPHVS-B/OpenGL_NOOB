Compile and run and you should see two sprites, aligned diagonally, displaying one half of a clown sprite, the whole of which I manually translated from an image into a small array of unsigned chars. Don't do this, its stupid, code up some library to do it for you instead.
Also when I say "Compile and run and you *should* see two sprites," I mean compile and run and you will probably get a bunch of errors.
